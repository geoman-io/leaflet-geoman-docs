### Snapping

Snap the dragged marker/vertex to other layers for precision drawing.  
Snapping can be disabled for layers with the layer option `snapIgnore: true`. With `snapIgnore: false` it will be always snappable, also if `pmIgnore` is set.
Can also be disabled by holding the `ALT` key.

#### Configuration

Snapping is disabled by default. You can enable snapping by setting `snappable` to `true` in the global options.

```js
map.pm.setGlobalOptions({ 
  snappable: true, 
);
```

You can get the current snappable status by calling `map.pm.getGlobalOptions().snappable`.

or by destructuring the `snappable` property from the `global` options.

```js
const { snappable } = this.map.pm.getGlobalOptions()
```

#### Snapping Button in the Toolbar

You can also enable/disable a button in the toolbar to toggle snapping. You can enable (disable) it by setting `snappingOption` to `true` (`false`) in the `addControls` options.

```js
map.pm.addControls({ 
  snappingOption: true, 
});
```
