## v2.16.0

### !! Breaking Changes !!

_This is only relevant for projects using very old versions of babel/webpack loaders_

This version introduces new build tools in the library build toolchain. More specifically we have swapped webpack for eslint. This has improved our build speeds and made the build pipeline simpler and easier to maintain going forward.
However the move to esbuild has also caused the library build assets (minified js files) to be compiled using a more modern version of ECMAScript. The current build files now use the [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) ?. syntax and this can cause issues with projects using older versions of webpack/babel or similar loaders.

If you face issues with upgrading to version v2.16.0 we suggest that you upgrade your own loaders and build toolchain to a version compatible with modern ECMAScript syntax.

### Minor Changes 

* Add Kyrgyz translation: #1448

### Patches 

* Update translation for rotation button title: #1442
* Fix handling of drawing modes after disabling a control button: #1424
* Unbind global listeners after the map is removed: #1434
* Sort snapping layers by priority in a radius of 5px: #1454
* Force rotateEnabled() to always return a boolean: #1455

### Chores

* Updates esbuild to 8.56, prettier to 3.2.4 and fixes lint config (1444) and swap to esbuild by @mscno in https://github.com/geoman-io/leaflet-geoman/pull/1445
